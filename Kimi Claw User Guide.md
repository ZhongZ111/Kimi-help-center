2. Usage Tips
Many people treat Kimi Claw as a “tool that answers questions”. In practice, it’s a configurable assistant: set rules for persona and memory; teach methods to build habits; give a schedule to drive work forward.
2.1 Customize the persona
- Kimi Claw’s reply style isn’t fixed. With one instruction, you can change its role, tone, and format—more humorous, more rigorous, more like a product manager, or more like a study buddy. You can tune it from three angles: 
  - Name and Identity: give it a new name and a role/job identity
  - Speaking Style: shorter, more polite, more playful, or more formal
  - Fixed Opening/Closing: add a standard opener, or end with one action item
- Examples:
  - From now on, your name is ‘Steven’. You are my information assistant. Start every reply with: Good, then answer.
  - From now on, use a three-part format: conclusion, reasons, actionable steps. No fluff.
  - You are a rigorous investment research analyst. Mark uncertainty for every conclusion and include one risk note.

2.2 Learning Skills
- Kimi Claw has a built-in  Clawhub Skill Library . When you want it to do a task, you don’t have to teach from scratch—ask it to find and install a high-quality Skill, like adding a dedicated module. Good use cases: 
  - Information synthesis: news briefs, competitor comparisons, meeting notes templates
  - Analysis: stock/industry mapping, data interpretation, risk extraction
  - Workflow: A complete set of processes from requirements → decomposition → output → review 
  - Example narrative:
    - Check out what opportunities there are in recent stocks. First, go search for and obtain the Skill related to Class A Share market data and analysis ideas, then install and analyze using the Skill.
    - Conduct a competing product analysis. First, find a suitable competing product analysis Skill, then ask me for necessary information step by step.
- You can also teach it your own best practices, or share Skills you already have. Teach it by providing:
  - Process: how you normally do this work (what to search first, how to judge, how to present)
  - Standards: what you care about most (accuracy, speed, actionability, risk control)
  - Templates: your preferred output format (structure, fields, length)

2.3 Set a scheduled task
- Kimi Claw can run scheduled tasks. With clear timing and output requirements, it becomes an automatic reminder and an information radar. For reliable execution, state three things at once: 
  - Time: when to run (specific date / daily time / day of week)
  - Output: how to deliver (bullets, table, template, length, language)
  - Constraints: must/must-not rules (≤200 words, Chinese only, include a risk note, only 3 items, etc.)
- Example:
  -  Every day at 9:00, summarize the latest market news: 3 bullets + 1 risk note, in Chinese, within 200 words.
  - Remind me in 1 hour to continue today’s daily report, and include the template (four-part).
  - Tonight at 22:30, remind me: shut down my computer, wash up, get ready to sleep. Use a gentle tone.
- Recommended Template:
    At [time], do [task], output [format], and follow [constraints].
    If you state all three clearly, Kimi Claw’s execution is more consistent and it’s easier to build long-term automation habits.

2.4 Set up Telegram Bot
The built-in Skill of Kimi Claw will assist you in configuring different channels. You can send "I want to configure the Telegram robot" and bot will provide you with a step-by-step plan. More detailed steps.
- Configure Process
  - Open Telegram and chat with @BotFather (confirm the handle is exactly @BotFather).
  - Run /newbot, follow prompts, and save the token.
  - Tell Kimi Claw your telegram token, like 'my telegram bot token is 123456:xxxxxxxxx'
  - In setting, restart Kimi Claw
  - Find your bot in chat, you will receive a pairing code command, send it to Kimi Claw, like 'openclaw pairing approve telegram XXXXXXXX'. and it will help you complete the configuration. 
  - Then you can talk to your Kimi Claw in Telegram.
- Group Chat Setting
  - If your bot can't respond in group chat, send Kimi Claw this code to make sure groupPolicy is open. Replace botToken in with your token.
"telegram": {
  "enabled": true,
  "dmPolicy": "open",
  "allowFrom": ["*"],
  "botToken": "123456:xxxxx",
  "groups": {
    "*": {
      "requireMention": true
    }
  },
  "groupPolicy": "open",
  "streamMode": "partial"
}
  - Then in settings click "Restart Kimi Claw"
  - Invite your bot to group chat and promote it to admin so that it can receive messages. Then @ your bot and it will respond.

If you want to set other channels, find command in Chat Channels - OpenClaw and send it to Kimi Claw. We will support Terminal UI very soon.
